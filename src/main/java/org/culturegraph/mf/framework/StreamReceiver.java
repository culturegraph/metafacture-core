/**
 * Interface implemented by objects which can receive streams.
 * A stream is a sequence of calls to the methods of this interface.
 * The basic structure of the sequence of calls is as follows:
 *
 * STREAM = RECORD*
 * RECORD = startRecord, ENTITY_OR_LITERAL*, endRecord
 * ENTITY_OR_LITERAL = ENTITY | literal
 * ENTITY = startEntity, ENTITY_OR_LITERAL*, endEntity)
 *
 * The {@link WellformednessChecker} can be used to check if a stream conforms
 * to these rules.
